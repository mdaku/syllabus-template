<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>What’s this course about? (Probably just import this from a file - idea is to have all the boiler-plate stuff here)</p>
</div>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>If necessary, a different section with information on the particular objectives of the course (Again, import this from a file)</p>
</div>
<div id="general-course-information" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>General Course Information</h2>
<p>In general, I don’t really believe in rules for students. Do whatever you want, you are adults, but I do have rules for myself and I am pretty disciplined about them. I may break them if they conflict with other rules, or if I just feel like it, but don’t count on it:</p>
<div id="readings" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Readings</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I will teach students who legitimately want to learn. As such, I put in a number of safe-guards to make sure that the students in my classes have done their work before coming class.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="attendence" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Attendence</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I refuse to take attendence. It is my belief that you are adults and you want to learn (see above). I expect that if you must miss a class, it is because you have other priorities, and that you have weighed the cost/benefit of them accordingly. If you have a documented reason to miss class (e.g. a note from a doctor), then please let me know immediately and arrangements can be made. Let me be clear: the only time I need to hear about you missing a class is if it was not a decision you made. If you choose to go on a ski trip, that’s great! I hope you had fun, please don’t tell me about it. If you broke your leg on that ski trip and need to miss another class to go to get a cast, that’s karma - but it’s also a legitimate reason to miss a class and you should tell me.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="e-mails" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>E-mails</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I will not reply to e-mails on evenings or weekends.</li>
<li>I will not answer questions that are answered on the syllabus.</li>
<li>I will not answer e-mails about why you are going to miss a class / why you missed a class. See `Attendence.’</li>
<li>I will not answer in-depth questions about course material by e-mail (I am available almost every day on campus to talk)</li>
<li>I will reply to e-mails within one business day. If you e-mail me on Monday at 8pm, you can expect an e-mail before Wednesday 9am. If you e-mail me on Friday at 9am of a long weekend, you can expect an e-mail by the following Tuesday at 9am.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="encrypted-e-mails" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Encrypted E-mails</h3>
<p>I am an advocate of internet privacy and I try to encourage everyone I know to take it seriously. One good way to ensure private communications is to encrpyt your e-mail. To encourage you to do this, I have the following additional rules:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I <em>will</em> reply to any e-mail, even if it breaks one or all of my rules above, if it is encrypted using PGP.</li>
<li>I will always answer encrypted e-mails <em>first</em>, and I will process them with my personal e-mail (which means I will likely answer it faster, though there is no guarantee)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="office-hours" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I hold office hours on Tuesday-Thursday between 1-2pm. I prioritize meeting with students who have set up appointments (you can do so <a href="www.markdaku.com">here</a>), though I am obviously thrilled to chat with anyone who drops by during that time.</li>
<li>I will make arrangements to meet with students who cannot attend my office hours within one week of them e-mailing me.</li>
<li>I will keep meetings to their scheduled time.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="classroom-environment" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Classroom Environment</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I will not tolerate disruptive classroom behavior. However, I also believe you are adults who want to learn. If you believe that the best way to do that is to sit in the back of the classroom and scroll through instagram, then go right ahead. The exceptions are during exames, and if your actions are distracting to other students. Your actions always have to take into account that you are in a shared space.</p></li>
<li><p>I will ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to learn.</p></li>

<h2>Grade Appeals</h2>
<p>Errors of arithmetic, etc. will be fixed immediately during office hours with my sincere apologies.
