# syllabus-template
A template for syllabi (requires RBookDown)

Clone and then fork this template and start building a course that already has all the contact info / admin info, etc. 
The idea here is that you only ever have to update your master template (e.g. with new contact info, etc.) and the rest of your course stays the same.  Not sure if it will play out that way in reality though.
